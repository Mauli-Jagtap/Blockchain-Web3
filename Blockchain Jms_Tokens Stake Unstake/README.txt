# Blockchain DeFi Smart Contract Prototype

This repository showcases a Blockchain DeFi Smart Contract Prototype developed using Solidity. The project includes functionality for stake/unstake tokens, demonstrating key features of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.

# Key Features:

# 1. Stake/Unstake Tokens
   - Users can stake tokens into the smart contract and earn rewards.
   - Users can unstake tokens, allowing them to withdraw their funds from the contract.
   - The system includes simple staking logic with basic rewards.

# 2. Lending/Borrowing System
   - Users can deposit tokens as collateral and borrow other tokens.
   - The system includes basic logic for loan issuance, repayment, and collateral withdrawal.
   - Simple DeFi logic with clear functions for deposits, loans, and repayments.

# 3. ERC-20 Token Creation
   - ERC-20 token creation with minting and burning functionality.
   - Mint new tokens and burn tokens to reduce the supply.
   - Capped total supply ensures a fixed number of tokens in circulation.

# Next Steps:
- Staking/Unstaking: Future improvements could include adding rewards for staking, staking periods, and interest calculations.
- Lending/Borrowing: Add features like interest rates, multiple collateral types, and liquidity pool integration.
- ERC-20 Token: Explore decentralized exchanges (DEXs) for listing, trading, or implementing staking rewards.

# Technologies Used:
- Solidity: Smart contract development language.
- Ethereum Blockchain: The decentralized network where the contract is deployed.
- Remix IDE: The integrated development environment used for compiling, testing, and deploying the smart contract.
- MetaMask (Optional): A browser extension for interacting with the Ethereum network and managing wallet transactions.

# How to Use:
1. Install MetaMask (or another Ethereum wallet) and configure.
2. Deploy the contract via Remix IDE or interact with an existing deployed contract through Remix or any compatible front-end interface.
3. Test the staking/unstaking system, lending/borrowing features, and ERC-20 token functions.
